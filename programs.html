                    <p>
                        <strong>Our Survivor Grant</strong> is a South Florida mutual aid initiative that
                        provides unrestricted financial support to survivors of sexual and
                        domestic violence, with a focus on queer and trans people of color
                        (QTPOC). Designed to address both urgent and long-term needs, the
                        grant allows recipients to use funds however they see fit. Past
                        recipients have used the grant for essentials like housing, healthcare,
                        therapy, legal aid, education, transportation, and more. Some have
                        even used it to launch their own mutual aid projects, continuing the
                        cycle of care within their communities.
                        <br><br>
                        By removing restrictions, we empower survivors to prioritize their
                        healing, safety, and stability on their own terms. This grant isn’t
                        just financial support-it’s a commitment to restoring autonomy,
                        dignity, and agency as survivors rebuild and reclaim their lives.
                        <br><br>
                        We distribute <strong>$200 grants twice a year</strong>, on <strong>July 1 (Summer)</strong> and
                        <strong>December 1 (Winter)</strong>, on a <em>first-come</em>, <em>first-served</em> basis. To
                        ensure
                        the grant reaches those who need it most, we ask recipients to upload
                        proof of South Florida residency. We are fully accommodating of
                        individuals without formal documentation and accept alternative
                        forms of verification beyond government-issued ID.

                    <p>
                        The <strong>Survivor Book Club</strong> is a bi-weekly, peer-led space created to
                        support <strong>QTPOC survivors of violence</strong> through collective healing,
                        learning, and reflection. Each session features a thoughtfully
                        chosen book exploring trauma, systemic violence, and paths toward
                        liberation, with discussions guided by our QTPOC survivor-led board.
                        <br><br>
                        While all survivors are welcome, the club is intentionally designed <strong>by and for QTPOC
                            survivors</strong>. To
                        ensure accessibility, participants receive both <strong>physical and audiobook formats</strong>,
                        along with a <strong>journal
                            and pen</strong> for personal reflection. We also offer a hybrid option for those who cannot
                        attend in
                        person. We cover 1–2 chapters per session, fostering meaningful conversations where survivors
                        can
                        share insights, emotions, and experiences in a supportive, confidential space. Additionally, a
                        <strong>mental health therapist is present at every meeting</strong> to provide emotional
                        support
                        and crisis care as
                        needed.
                        <br><br>
                        More than just a book club, this is a healing community: a consistent, affirming space where
                        survivors can process together, reclaim power, and imagine a world free from violence.

                    <p>
                        The <strong>Full Moon Survivor Wellness Series (FMSWS)</strong> is a monthly mental
                        health and wellness workshop series designed for <strong>QTPOC survivors
                            of violence</strong>, held on or near the full moon, a time symbolizing
                        reflection, release, and renewal.
                        <br><br>
                        Led by community healing experts, each workshop teaches diverse holistic practices such as
                        <strong>yoga,
                            meditation, reiki, sexual healing, art therapy, self-defense, nature-based healing, and
                            more</strong>,
                        empowering survivors to explore tools that best support their well-being. Following each
                        session, survivors share a <strong>communal meal and participate in a talking circle</strong>, a
                        safe space to
                        connect, express, and build solidarity. The series includes <strong>ASL interpretation and
                            access to
                            mental health therapists</strong>, ensuring full support and accessibility for survivors of
                        all
                        backgrounds.
                        <br><br>
                        More than wellness workshops, FMSWS fosters a nurturing community where survivors can heal,
                        grow, and thrive together.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Whole Selves</strong> is a trauma-informed, queer-inclusive, and culturally grounded sex
                        education
                        conference designed to empower students (especially students of color and QTPOC) through
                        holistic, accessible, and affirming learning spaces.
                        <br><br>
                        The conference covers essential topics like <strong>STI prevention, mental health, consent,
                            boundaries,
                            gender identity, and healthy relationships</strong>, connecting sexual wellness to emotional
                        and mental
                        well-being. Through expert-led workshops, interactive discussions, and resource-sharing,
                        students gain practical tools to navigate their sexual health, build self-awareness, and foster
                        respectful relationships.
                        <br><br>
                        To support students beyond the classroom, Whole Selves offers free wellness
                        resources-<strong>including
                            condoms, lube, Narcan, Plan B, period products, and on-site STI testing</strong>-ensuring
                        attendees leave
                        with both knowledge and tangible tools for safer, healthier living. <strong>Whole
                            Selves</strong> is also
                        committed to accessibility and inclusion, providing <strong>ASL and Spanish
                            interpretation</strong> to ensure
                        full engagement across language and ability differences.
                        <br><br>
                        This conference is especially urgent on college campuses where students of color are
                        underrepresented and disproportionately affected by sexual violence, STIs, and mental health
                        challenges. Traditional programs often overlook the specific needs of QTPOC students, creating
                        critical gaps in education and care. By teaching youth early about sexual health and healthy
                        relationships, <strong>Whole Selves</strong> helps prevent future violence and fosters healthier
                        ways of relating
                        to others. The conference confronts inequities head-on, centering marginalized voices and
                        culturally competent education to build a safer, more inclusive, and supportive campus community
                        for all.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Queer Fest</strong> is a transformative, all-QTPOC survivor-led art show that centers
                        healing through
                        creative expression. Featuring disabled and multiply-marginalized performers, it brings together
                        QTPOC survivors of violence to share art of all kinds, build community, and foster collective
                        healing.
                        <br><br>
                        Rooted in South Florida, Queer Fest has become a vital gathering for over 200 QTPOC survivors,
                        offering space to cry, laugh, resist, and heal in solidarity. More than just a show, it’s a
                        celebration of survival, connection, and artistic resilience.
                        <br><br>
                        At this show, accessibility is central. The event includes ASL interpretation, sensory rooms,
                        ramps, detailed maps, on-site mental health support, and a strong mask policy to protect
                        immunocompromised attendees. Queer Fest is a powerful act of care, community, and resistance.
